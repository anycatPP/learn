objective 
1define what an algorithm is
2 devise a plan to solve algorithms
3 compare and contarst prolem solving
patterns including frequency counters two pointer problem 
and divide and conquer
why do i need to know this?
almost everything that do you do in programming involves 
some kind of algorithm
its the foundation for being a successful problem solving 
developer
                also

how do you improve?
1.devise a plan for solving
2. master common problem solving patterns
A SIMPLE FOOLPROOF MAGICAL MIRACAULOUS FAIL SAFE APPROACH

.UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM
.EXPLORE CONCRETE EXAMPLES
.BREAK IT DOWN
.SOLVE/SIMPLIFY
.LOOK BACK AND REFACTOR
